I am a first-year PhD student at MILA and Polytechnique Montréal, advised by [Sarath Chandar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=yxWtZLAAAAAJ) and [Amal Zouaq](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lqDGv9YAAAAJ). My work has spanned transformer-based information retrieval and foundation models for CAD generation. I am currently interested in language-model–based agents (with a focus on memory-augmented agents) and language model interpretability, with an emphasis on faithfulness.

Previously, I was a researcher at the National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo) under the supervision of [Akiko Aizawa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JQy5hPoAAAAJ&hl=en). I received an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Bologna in October 2023, where I was supervised by [Paolo Torroni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uOZZjwsAAAAJ).
